			<div id="contentLeft">
    			
    			<p>Quinoa (pronounced Keen-Wah) is a grain that is considered to be almost a complete food. Very high in protein, full of vitamins, totally gluten free, wheat free and cholesterol free. It is usually organic, easy to digest of great benefit to everyone and simply delicious.</p> 
    			<p>Quinoa is a pure and complete 100% grain and an almost perfect food. That is why I refer to it as the Supergrain, the Supergrain of the Century as its degree of nutrition is regarded as being quite potent. </p>
    			<h2>History</h2>
    			<p>It is an ancient grain native to the Andes Mountains in South America. It has been around for over 5,000 years and is known as the ancient and staple food of the ancient civilisation of the Incas having sustained them for centuries.</p>
    			<h2>Resurgence in Popularity</h2>
    			<p>It has now been rediscovered and resurfaced to become, in my mind, the superfood of our future, and, with all the food allergies that are so prevalent in our society especially with gluten and wheat intolerances, a welcome addition to our diet.</p>
				<h2>Cooking With Quinoa</h2>
    			<p>Quinoa has a huge range of uses and lends itself beautifully to so many dishes. When cooked it has a very delicate texture and is lovely in soups, sweets, makes wonderful salads, pasta, breads and delicious vegetarian and non vegetarian meals. A perfect food for Vegetarians and Coeliac Sufferers.</p>
