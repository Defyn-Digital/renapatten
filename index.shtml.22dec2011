    			<h2>What is Quinoa?</h2>
    			<p>Quinoa (pronounced Keen-Wah) is a grain that is considered to be almost a complete food. Very high in protein, full of vitamins, totally gluten free, wheat free and cholesterol free. It is usually organic, easy to digest of great benefit to everyone and simply delicious.</p> 
    			<p>Quinoa is a pure and complete 100% grain and an almost perfect food. That is why I refer to it as the Supergrain, the Supergrain of the Century as its degree of nutrition is regarded as being quite potent. </p>
    			<h2>History</h2>
    			<p>It is an ancient grain native to the Andes Mountains in South America. It has been around for over 5,000 years and is known as the ancient and staple food of the ancient civilisation of the Incas having sustained them for centuries.</p>
    			<h2>Resurgence in Popularity</h2>
    			<p>It has now been rediscovered and resurfaced to become, in my mind, the superfood of our future, and, with all the food allergies that are so prevalent in our society especially with gluten and wheat intolerances, a welcome addition to our diet.</p>

    			<h2>Cooking With Quinoa</h2>
				<img class="imgRight" src="images/quinoa-grain.jpg" alt="Quinoa comes in a variety of different grains" />
    			<p>Quinoa has a huge range of uses and lends itself beautifully to so many dishes. When cooked it has a very delicate texture and is lovely in soups, sweets, makes wonderful salads, pasta, breads and delicious vegetarian and non vegetarian meals. A perfect food for Vegetarians and Coeliac Sufferers.</p>
    			<h2>The Book</h2>
    			<p>In Rena Patten’s Cooking with Quinoa - The Supergrain you will find 90 recipes all using quinoa in grain, flake or flour form.

				 <p class="intro">This is a lovely salad, and great as an accompaniment with meat or fish. You can roast your own capsicums, or buy them ready roasted or chargrilled. The anchovies add an extra zing to the dressing, but you can leave them out. This has all the true flavours of the Mediterranean. Serves 4-6.</p>

				 <p>Place the quinoa in a small saucepan with the water, bring to the boil, then reduce the heat, cover and simmer for 10 minutes until all the water is absorbed. Remove from the heat and cool completely.</p>
                 <p>Halve the olives lengthways and place into a large bowl with the quinoa, olives, capers, sun-dried tomatoes capsicums, artichokes, beans, chilli, onion and herbs. Mix thoroughly.</p>
                 <p>For the dressing, place the anchovies, olive oil, vinegar, garlic and seasoning in a blender or mortar and pestle and whiz or grind together until blended.</p>
                 <p>Pour the dressing over the salad, check the seasoning  (you will need to add salt if not using the anchovies)  Chill for about 30 minutes before serving.</p>
