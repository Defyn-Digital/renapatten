    			<h2>What is Quinoa?</h2>
    			<p>Quinoa (pronounced Keen-Wah) is a grain that is considered to be almost a complete food. Very high in protein, full of vitamins, totally gluten free, wheat free and cholesterol free. It is usually organic, easy to digest of great benefit to everyone and simply delicious.</p>
    			<p>Quinoa is a pure and complete 100% grain and an almost perfect food. That is why I refer to it as the Supergrain, the Supergrain of the Century as its degree of nutrition is regarded as being quite potent.</p>
    			<h2>About Rena</h2>
